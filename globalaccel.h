/**
 * @short Interaction with KGlobalAccel.
 *
 * While the screen is locked, we want a few white listed global shortcuts to activate.
 * While the screen is locked KGlobalAcceld is not functional as the screen locker holds an
 * active X11 key grab and KGlobalAcceld does not get the key events. This prevents useful keys,
 * like volume control to no longer function.
 *
 * This class circumvents the problem by interacting with KGlobalAccel when the screen is locked
 * to still allow a few white listed shortcuts (like volume control) to function.
 *
 * As the screen is locked we can operate on a few assumptions which simplifies the interaction:
 * shortcuts won't change. The user cannot interact with the system thus the global shortcut won't
 * change while the screen is locked. This allows us to fetch the allowed shortcut information from
 * KGlobalAcceld when the screen gets locked and keep these information around till the screen is
 * unlocked. We do not need to update the information while the screen is locked.
 *
 * As the information is fetched in an async way from KGlobalAcceld there is a short time window
 * when the screen is locked, but the shortcut information is not fetched. This is considered a
 * not relevant corner case as we can assume that right when the screen locks (due to e.g. idle)
 * no user is in front of the system and is not able to press the shortcut or that the user directly
 * wants to cancel the lock screen again (grace time).
 *
 * Components are just registered by name in KGlobalAccel. This would in theory allow a malicious
 * application to register under a white listed name with white listed shortcuts and bind enough
 * shortcuts to turn this functionality into a key grabber to read the users password. To prevent such
 * attacks the shortcuts which can be invoked are restricted: the triggered key may not be a single
 * key in alphanumeric area with or without the shift keys. If a global shortcut contains an
 * alphanumeric key it will only be handled if also an additional modifier like Alt of Meta is pressed.
